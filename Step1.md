## General Steps with CAD packages

everything is very systematic, there is an order of operations generally which are needed except in edge cases.

## Majority of the time:

1. Start from a sketch
2. Do a Part
3. Do an Assembly

## Sketches

a. each sketch starts on a plane (choose top bottom or right plane)
b. depending on the plane chosen, the way the part "faces" is set.
c. draw a sketch, and then manipulate that sketch -- like **extruding**


## Exercise 1:

1. create a new part
2. select a plane
3. draw a sketch
4. control dimensions for the sketch
5. then extrude this part
 
## Exercise 2:

revolve -- choose an axis and revolve sketch around that axis.
sweep -- two sketches and a path, and will sweep across that path
loft -- two different sketches, and will sweep and merge from one to second shape
shell -- make all walls a certain thickness, great for complex geometries and 3d printing
fillets -- normally last step
