## General Steps with CAD packages

everything is very systematic, there is an order of operations generally which are needed except in edge cases.

## Majority of the time:

1. Start from a sketch
2. Do a Part
3. Do an Assembly

## Sketches

a. each sketch starts on a plane (choose top bottom or right plane)
b. depending on the plane chosen, the way the part "faces" is set.
c. draw a sketch, and then manipulate that sketch -- like **extruding**
